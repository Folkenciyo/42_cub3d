[THEORY]

	- Player position
		* x_pos  -- unit?
		* y_pos  -- unit?
		* angle (alfa) of PoV -- unit? (radians?)
		* vector (angle) of player PoV  -- unit? 
	
	- Coordinates:
		* Top left corner --> 0,0
	
	- Map:
		2 dimensional array [][]
	
	- Angle (PoV) of player:
	 * Must stay at 2(pi) to avoid overflow --> Add 2(pi) if negative; substract 2(pi) if overflows that amount
	 * Radians?
	
	- Unit vector:
		* Vector from 0,0 to where the player is
		* Every time we move, we have to add or substract to or from that position
			[x0,y0] +- [x1,y1]
