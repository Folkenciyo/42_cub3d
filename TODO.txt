[RAYCASTING]
	- [BUG] -> When calculating orientation, at the edges the calculation is not accurate
		* Change the rate at which we calculate the ray	--> Better but not perfect ❌✅

	- 	Still not fluent as we would like,
		it is the problem of the calculations, too high,
		see if we can diminish them
