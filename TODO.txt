[RAYCASTING]
	- [BUG] -> When calculating orientation, at the edges the calculation is not accurate
		* Change the rate at which we calculate the ray	--> Better but not perfect ❌✅


[NORMINETTE]
	- Make code Norminette-friendly ❌ 
	- We cannot define functions as macros; put variables within the structure to initialize them manually
	- Orient_3d, still not able to refactor
	- init_game, refactor it
	- put_pixel_minimap, refactor it

[PLAYER ORIENTATION] -- Orientate the player depending on the key given by the map - N S W E  ✅
